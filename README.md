# RISCV-Simulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/RISCV-Simulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LC-John/RISCV-Simulator)

This is a project of Computer Organization and Achitecture, PKU. LAB2 and LAB3.2 are included. I believe my solution is quite elegant and may sparks you.

The simulator simulates on RV64I and RV64F ISA. (There are still some bugs in RV64F, yet I'm not going to debug them.)

My report can be found at https://github.com/LC-John/Notes-and-homeworks/tree/master/体系实习.

# DO NOT COPY

Last but the most important thing is that you can reference them, but **PLEASE DO NOT COPY**! If you copy this project and get caught, no one can help you, and you deserve nothing but a zero score. 

Heads up! I've inserted something into my code. It will somehow show the identification information of the true author, which is me. So anaing, **DO NOT COPY**.

Good luck and have fun. :)
